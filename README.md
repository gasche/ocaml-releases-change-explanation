This repository is the place of an ongoing experiment to find a good
way to explain/annotate/elaborate the list of changes of upcoming
OCaml releases. The goal is to let users quickly view what is new in
the language (even if they have not been closely following
the development), and in particular clearly understand any
compatibility-breaking change, what kind of code it affects and how
affected code should be modified.

The idea of a github repo is to encourage people to collect and
improve this information in a crowd-sourced way. Currently information
is collected on the wiki (I (@gasche) am still not sure whether using
the wiki is best, it may change in the future), see [the wiki home
page](../../wiki/).

List of releases with extra information:

- 4.04.0: [4.04.0 change explanation page](../../wiki/4.04.0-changes-explanation)
- 4.05.0: [4.05.0 change explanation page](../../wiki/4.05.0-changes-explanation)

For any question or comment, on the general process or on a change
item of a specific release, please feel free to [open an
issue](../../issues).
